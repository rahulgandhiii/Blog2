			<p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-top: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" >There's this void <br> I can't really explain <br> And if I ever tried <br> I'd be called 'deranged' <br> Nothing that I ever do <br> Feels worth it anymore <br> Feels like I'll always have a crisis <br> For forever and more <br> <br> Like a Catterpillar <br> Surrounded by Vibrant Butterflies <br> Why can't something I do <br> Just for once be right <br> Every acheivement I have feels like a favor <br> <b> Everyone, I fear, will one day become a traitor </b> <br> And whenever I try to have a fresh start <br> I am humbled by the cuts in my heart. </p>

		<div id="p2">
			<img src="p2.jpg">
			<p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-top: 5px; margin-right: 5px;"> <q>It only gets better</q> is a full fledged lie <br> Thus, everytime I need to apply a coat of dye <br> So I can retain the pain of having your heart torn. <br> Whilst everyone you've known had you warned. <br> Nothing I do has ever been enough <br> <br> And I realise everyone has had it rough. <br> So I continue what I've been doing <b> Losing, losing, losing and losing </b> <br> Temporary is a word, that I live by because <br> "It only gets better" is a full fledged lie </p>

		<div id="p3">
			<img src="p3.jpg">
			<p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-top: 5px; margin-right: 5px;"> Crossing all the greatest oceans <br> I would've confessed my love for you <br> Being the answer to my questions <br> Was the only thing you had to do <br> I stay tied up, with the strings you made <br> <b> As I watch the reality of us fade </b> <br> Into the dark, out of your mind <br> As I become an insignificant chapter of your life <br> If I were the poet, we could have been the poetry <br> But you were the author and we were the book put aside for eternity. </p>

	<div class="l2">
		<div id="p4">
			<img src="p4.jpg">
			<p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-top: 5px; margin-right: 5px;"> The poison, the cure, the pain I endured. <br> The charade, the ruse, the memory of the bruise <br>My heartbreak, our wake, <br> <b> The death of us and it's ache. </b> <br> Your heart was a jewel and mine was to break <br> The destiny I thought we had ceases to exist <br> Your mind, your soul, I find hard to resist.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="p5">
			<img src="p5.jpg">
			<p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-top: 5px; margin-right: 5px;"> I am drenched in the pain <br> That comes from the thirst you inflicted. <br> Still bound, still chained <br> Like a maniac, like an addict <br> I lie with the losses <br> I wake with the memories <br> <b> In this loveless maze </b> <br>I am engulfed in your nonexistent haze. </p>
		</div>
		<div id="p6">
			<img src="p6.jpg">
			<p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-top: 5px; margin-right: 5px;"> My wounds didn't heal, <br> I had to bury them deep <br> And to transform into scars. <br> I put my life in jars, <br> Gathered, organized, stuffed and put away. <br> <b> The wounds, the scars, the jars have turned grey. </b> <br> Grey from neglect, Grey from the dirt, Grey from being buried <br> Red for the shame, <br> Red from the pain of being the one who had to bleed.</p>

			<p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-top: 5px; margin-right: 5px;"> And if by some miracle, <br> All our stars somehow align <br> I hope you know I won't let us shine <br> For you've tossed my heart and shattered it for far too long <br> Being the only other eyewitness, it is, now I realize, too wrong <br> <b> I am a secret of yours, destined to be concealed </b> <br> And ours is a matter, I wish deeply to be sealed <br> You and I have a bond so unforgettable <br> Wish I could forget that we're too imperfect to be stable</p>
		</div>
		<div id="p8">
			<img src="p8.jpg">
			<p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-top: 5px; margin-right: 5px;"> Every February <br> I still remember <br> How we shared each memory <br> That led to our failure <br> And in the month of love <br> I am forced to face <br> <b> How all fragments of my heart were crushed <br> When I fell in love but you liked the chase </b> <br> Holding onto you was my mistake <br> This loop I have been trapped in, why won't it break? </p>
		</div>
		<div id="p9">
			<img src="p9.jpg">
			<p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-top: 5px; margin-right: 5px;"> God knows you needed <br> The love that I gave <br> To be a momentary haven <br> In this endless cave <br> I no longer love you <br> Nor will I ever <br> What I gave you was true <br> And you'll be in my prayers forever <br>You didn't ask <br> But I'll forget you anyway <br> And someday, by some chance if we ever pass <br> Don't come towards me or say hey <br> <b> I might have forgotten but not forgiven <br> How you once left my heart so frail </b> </p>

			<p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-top: 5px; margin-right: 5px;"> Within us I try to find <br> Not you, but the solace and tranquility <br> <b> That bloomed inside me with every step we took </b><br> And I try to walk those walks again <br> Disguising my intentions even from myself <br> Searching for a feeling so familiar <br> For it is impossible to retain within my fists <br> I do not desire your presence <br> But remain vexed by your past <br> For it was too cruelly loving <br> To someone who hadn't yet broken his own heart <br> It is not you that I want but it is me myself <br> A time so simple that led to pure laughs <br> Born out of rejoice and contentment <br> Satisfaction that I once had <br> Self hate that I once did not shed <br> Confidence that I once knew <br> And the peace within me that beautifully grew</p>

		<div id="p11">

			<p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-top: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" > Healing from you was harder than being on fire <br> Every night now I can't sleep till it's before 5 <br> And I Hope you get what it is you desire <br> Cut me up, cut us off so I don't see you thrive <br> Said I was the only one who made you feel safe <br> Then how come I find myself standing at our grave <br> You told me that I handled your anxiety graciously <br> What a fool I was to believe you so half-wittedly <br> Why did you have to uproot the branch joining us <br> <b> Now all's that left is broken promises and a curse </b> <br> I chased after you cause you chased after me <br> Now I exit the island where I was stranded miserably <br> And I feel the final remnants of us leave me be <br> Today I move on from what was once my priority <br> And I know when I drown is when I'm finally free <br> I pray that one day you become more mature <br> And you find the peace I was ready to offer</p>

			<p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-top: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" > Exhausted from always asking how are you <br> Now no one asks whether my face shows the truth <br> And I have been feeling left out ever since I turned 9 <br> Now anything I do appears as if its a crime <br> What do I have to do to prove my worth <br> <b> Being the gifted one has been more of a curse </b> <br> All one has to do is expect <br> And all that's expected is what I accept <br> I worked with my outmost dedication <br> To get nothing in return <br> Put down by fate, leading me to ruin <br> I wish I did not work to my capability earlier <br> For it was in vain and all it did was cause me pain <br> Everyone assumes I always lived at the peak  <br> Not a soul now sees how I endured the trek <br> And all of this, All this for what? <br> For the expectations put on me, I now fall short</p>

	<div class="end"> <p id="endsec" style="margin-top: 20px;"> With the submission of this file. <br> I lay to rest, my feelings for the muse. <br> Worshipped you with purity,  <br> Loved you aunthentically, <br> Took my revenge, Stole my closure, <br> Vanished from your Life, <br> For now and forever. <br> I hope I meet you in another life <br> And you once again crush my delicate heart... <p>
